# .NET Framework Sample Programs
## ***Introduction***
The Adobe PDF Library (APDFL) is an Application Programming Interface (API) designed to allow programmers to work with the Adobe PDF file format.  The APDFL Software Development Kit (SDK) provides a method for software developers and vendors to build their own third-party systems that allow them to create, change, process, review, and otherwise work with PDF files. The Library is the same one that Adobe Acrobat is based on.

Datalogics provides a .NET Framework interface to the Adobe PDF Library. This Interface offers a set of modules for the Library that allow programmers working in C# or other languages supported by .NET Framework to take advantage of Adobe PDF Library tools and resources. This interface encapsulates the original Adobe PDF Library; the interface allows you to work with the original library functions directly, and seamlessly, in .NET Framework.

## ***The Sample Programs***
The Adobe PDF Library supports all of the languages that work with .NET Framework, including C# and Visual Basic. The Adobe PDF Library provides a set of sample C# program files, stored under /DotNetFramework/Sample_Source.

Many of these sample programs automatically generate an output file or set of files.  These output files, generally PDF or graphics files (JPG or BMP), are stored in the directory where the application has been run. If you run a sample program a second or third time, it will overwrite any output files that were created and stored earlier.  However, if you run a sample program, generate a PDF output file, and then open that PDF file and try to run that sample program again, you will see an error message.  The program will not be able to overwrite an existing output file if that file is currently open in Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat.
